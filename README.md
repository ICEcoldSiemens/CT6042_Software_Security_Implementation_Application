# CT6042_Software_Security_Implementation_Application
Implemented five dangerous software errors (vulnerable code), exploit and fix, and based on implementations then write a secure software development framework/guideline that discusses those implemented five dangerous software errors (such as Buffer Overruns).

1. Demonstrate how the vulnerability can be exploited with code examples?
2. Demonstrate how the code was tested to identify vulnerability?
3. Demonstrate how to mitigate, what security measures were put into place?
4. Test again to make sure the code is resilient to the chosen attack
5. Your framework should also include general discussion about:

The importance of Security Development Life Cycle
Product risk assessment and risk analysis
You should include all implemented source code in the appendix of your report. Note that the appendix does not count towards your report word count. <br></br>

You should carefully consider the following when writing your report:

Style – suitable to be quickly read and comprehended. <br></br>
Content – relevant, clearly explained, logically organised. <br></br>
Authority – discussed concepts and ideas will need evidence in support. <br></br>
Practical understanding – your own practical examples, advice and demonstrations should be included. <br></br>
Technical understanding – understanding of the discussed system and consideration of comparison products.<br></br>
Comprehensiveness – you need to cover what you consider to be all the key topics.<br></br>
Helpfulness – practical examples, advice and demonstrations should be included <br></br>
